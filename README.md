##The Project



[Recent studies][13] performed with 11.320 Harvard Alumni showed that the physical activities that burn from 1000 to 2000 calories per week may reduce the risk of stroke for a normal person in 24%. The same study showed that in case of burning from 2000 to 3000 calories per week the risk of stroke risk is reduced in around 46%.

Just in the United States, every year strokes killed more than 150 000 people, not just strokes, but several different health problems related to the sedentary life make every day new victims.  Even with the available information, another [recent studies][14] showed that the number of sedentary people has increased on the past year. 

On this project our main goal was to boost our userâ€™s motivation in order to get rid of sedentary life. What we discovered is that one key of motivation for exercising is [Goals Setting][15]. For helping our users with goal setting and health measurements control we developed uCoach.

Using uCoach, our user is able to set daily or date-fixed goals and store health measures, controlling if the goals were achieved or not.  

For that, we created goals based on the following measures and cases:
-	Weight (Gaining or loosing weight)
-	Steps (Walking x steps)
-	Calories (Spending x calories)
-	Running (Running x kilometers)
-	Walking (Walking x kilometers)
-	Cycling (Cycling x kilometers)
-	Sleeping (Sleeping x hours a day)
